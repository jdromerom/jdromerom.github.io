	abstract = {Summary Seismic inversion is the prime method to estimate subsurface properties from seismic data. However, such inversion is a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of the data. Consequently, the data misfit term must be augmented with appropriate regularization that incorporates prior information about the sought-after solution. Conventionally, model-based regularization terms are problem-dependent and hand-crafted; this can limit the modeling capability of the inverse problem. Recently, a new framework has emerged under the name of Plug-and-Play (PnP) regularization, which suggests reinterpreting the effect of the regularizer as a denoising problem. Convolutional neural networks-based denoisers are state-of-the-art methods for image denoising: their adoption in the PnP framework has led to algorithms with improved capabilities over classical regularization in computer vision and medical imaging applications. In this work, we present a comparison between standard model-based and data-driven regularization techniques in post-stack seismic inversion and give some insights into the optimization and denoiser-related parameters tuning. The results on synthetic seismic data indicate that PnP regularization using a bias-free CNN-based denoiser with an additional noise map as input can outperform standard model-based methods.},

	abstract = {Time-lapse (4D) seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid-flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage. The process of inverting 4D seismic data for reservoir properties is a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data and inaccuracies in the repeatability of 4D acquisition surveys. Consequently, ad-hoc regularization strategies are essential for the 4D seismic inverse problem to obtain geologically meaningful subsurface models and associated 4D changes. Motivated by recent advances in the field of convex optimization, we propose a joint inversion-segmentation algorithm for 4D seismic inversion that integrates total variation and segmentation priors as a way to counteract missing frequencies and present noise in 4D seismic data. The proposed inversion framework is designed for poststack seismic data and applied to a pair of seismic volumes from the open Sleipner 4D seismic data set. Our method has three main advantages over state-of-the-art least-squares inversion methods. First, it produces high-resolution baseline and monitor acoustic models. Second, it mitigates nonrepeatable noise and better highlights real 4D changes by leveraging similarities between multiple data. Finally, it provides a volumetric classification of the acoustic impedance 4D difference model (4D changes) based on user-defined classes (i.e., percentages of speedup or slowdown in the subsurface). Such advantages may enable more robust stratigraphic/structural and quantitative 4D seismic interpretation and provide more accurate inputs for dynamic reservoir simulations. Alongside presenting our novel inversion method, we introduce a streamlined data preprocessing sequence for the 4D Sleipner poststack seismic data set that includes time-shift estimation and well-to-seismic tie. Finally, we provide insights into the open-source framework for large-scale optimization that we used to implement the proposed algorithm in an efficient and scalable manner.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification is a crucial component in any geophysical inverse problem, as it provides decision makers with valuable information about the inversion results. Seismic inversion is a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem, due to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data; as such, quantifying the uncertainties associated with the ill-posed nature of this inversion process is essential for qualifying the subsequent interpretation and decision-making processes. Selecting appropriate prior information is a crucial — yet nontrivial — step in probabilistic inversion because it influences the ability of sampling-based inference algorithms to provide geologically plausible posterior samples. However, the necessity to encapsulate prior knowledge into a probability distribution can greatly limit our ability to define expressive priors. To address this limitation and following in the footsteps of the plug-and-play (PnP) methodology for deterministic inversion, we develop a regularized variational inference framework that performs posterior inference by implicitly regularizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss — a measure of the distance between the approximated and target probabilistic distributions — with a convolutional neural network-based denoiser. We call this new algorithm PnP Stein variational gradient descent and determine its ability to produce high-resolution trustworthy samples that realistically represent subsurface structures. Our method is validated on synthetic and field poststack seismic data.},

	abstract = {Seismic reservoir characterization represents a cornerstone in the process of quantitatively analyzing and interpreting the subsurface. Whether seismic data are inverted for acoustic, elastic, and/or petrophysical properties, the associated inverse problem is usually hindered by the band-limited and noisy character of seismic data; prior information must therefore be provided to mitigate the ill-posed nature of such a problem. Common approaches to seismic inversion rely on a specific form of regularization, herein called external regularization, which tries to impose external knowledge of the subsurface (e.g., smoothness within layers or blockiness at layer discontinuities) on the sought-after properties. While the geophysical community is well versed with smooth priors such as Laplacian or directional Laplacian operators, advances in the field of convex optimization have recently led to the creation of more sophisticated seismic inversion engines that can include nonsmooth priors, such as total variation regularization. In this contribution, we present a unified approach to seismic inversion under the umbrella of convex optimization, which allows for the inclusion of different levels of prior knowledge encapsulating both our geophysical and geological understanding of the subsurface. More specifically, we discuss how the primal-dual solver represents an ideal optimization engine for the inclusion of external, internal (i.e., based on self-similarity within the solution), and geological priors in both static and dynamic post and prestack seismic reservoir characterization. Numerical examples of synthetic and field data are used to validate the effectiveness of our framework in extracting more information from seismic datasets, both in terms of resolution and accuracy, in comparison to other methods routinely used by the geophysical community.},

	abstract = {Seismic reservoir characterization refers to a set of techniques aimed at estimating static and/or dynamic physical properties of subsurface geological formations from seismic data, with applications ranging from exploration and development of energy resources, geothermal production, carbon capture and storage, and the assessment of geological hazards. Extracting quantitative information from seismic recordings, such as an acoustic impedance model, is however a highly ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of the seismic data. As such, seismic inversion techniques strongly rely on additional prior information that penalizes (or promotes) some features in the recovered model. This paper introduces IntraSeismic, a novel hybrid seismic inversion method that combines implicit neural representations as an effective way to parameterize a subsurface model with the physics of the seismic modeling operator. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both pre-stack and 3D/4D post-stack seismic inversion using synthetic and field data sets. Key features of IntraSeismic are (a) unparalleled performance in 2D and 3D pre-stack/post-stack dynamic and static seismic inversion, (b) rapid convergence rates, (c) ability to seamlessly include hard constraints (i.e., well data) and perform uncertainty quantification, and (d) potential data compression and fast randomized access to specific portions of the inverted model.},

	abstract = {Summary Removing noise present in seismic data is of prime importance for seismic processing workflows and a matter of continuous research in the academic community. The challenging part of seismic noise suppression is the diverse nature of seismic noise: it is found as a combination of random and coloured noise, which can be both structured and unstructured. Algorithms based on signal decomposition, domain transformation, and filtering, among others, have been traditionally applied to denoise seismic data and have been successful for specific imaging targets, hence mostly identifying a specific seismic noise component. Recently, convolutional neural networks-based (CNN) denoisers have greatly outperformed standard denoising techniques mostly in natural and medical imaging applications, and furthermore, self-supervised frameworks have been proposed as a clever alternative to denoising when no ground truth exists. This work leverages four state-of-the-art U-Net type architectures in a novel self-supervised fashion to remove seismic noise. The training seismic data corresponds to a generous number of real seismic surveys. For the labelling, trace-wise corruption is applied to patches of the input data, so the CNN learns to predict the corrupted traces based on the receptive field. Our findings indicate that self-supervised learning using U-Net type architecture trained on real data is able to considerably remove both structured and unstructured seismic noise.},

	abstract = {Summary Seismic monitoring is a crucial component for any CO2 subsurface storage project aimed at enhanced oil recovery or as part of a climate change mitigation strategy. The Sleipner CO2 monitoring programme is a repeated seismic survey acquired in the Norwegian North Sea to monitor the evolution of the injected CO2 plume in the subsurface and identify possible geohazards. Robust quantitative interpretation of the Sleipner dataset remains a challenge due to the non-repeatable noise between surveys and the tuning effects present in the data. In this work, we propose to apply a 4D joint inversion-segmentation approach with the aim of estimating the acoustic impedance models for the baseline and monitor datasets as well as classifying their difference into user-defined time-lapse classes. Introducing a segmentation constraint in the inversion process is beneficial in that it enforces the difference between the inverted models to belong to a predefined set of classes, minimizing the non-repeatable noise and enhancing genuine 4D changes. Our results are superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art least-squares inversion techniques and pave the way for an improved understanding of CO2 migration in the subsurface.},

	abstract = {Summary Geophysical data are notoriously contaminated by noise, some of which may behave as outlier to the rest of the data. Least absolute deviations can successfully handle such outliers, however it requires the L1-norm of the data to be minimized, which is much harder to minimize than the L2- norm commonly used in least-squares. The problem lies in the non-differentiability of the L1-norm, which prohibits the efficient use of gradient based methods. In recent years, algorithms based on the proximal operator have gained great popularity in the mathematical community, due to their ability to efficiently minimize objective function consisting of both a smooth and a non-smooth part. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is one such algorithms that is able to solve a large class of problems. In this work, we present a new ADMM-type solver that can handle objective functions that are the sum of an L1 data fidelity term and an L1 regularization term. We apply our algorithm to the problem of seismic deblending and compare it against the IRLS method of Ibrahim and Sacchi (2014) .},

	abstract = {Seismic inversion translates seismic data into subsurface elastic property models, enabling geophysicists to better understand underground rocks and fluids. Due to the inherently ill-posed nature of this inverse problem, accurately capturing the uncertainty associated with the solution is essential for reliable interpretations. Traditional Bayesian inversion methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Laplace approximations, have been employed for this purpose but face significant limitations in terms of scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale problems. Combined with deep learning, Variational Inference (VI) has emerged as a promising alternative, striking a balance between computational efficiency and flexibility (i.e. the ability to approximate complex posterior distributions). However, selecting an appropriate proposal distribution remains a key challenge, as it directly influences the quality of the estimated posterior distribution. In this study, we extend IntraSeismic, an implicit neural representation (INR)-based framework for seismic inversion applications, to Bayesian inversion using VI with different parametrizations of the proposal distribution. We introduce two methods: B-IntraSeismic (BIS), which uses a mean-field Gaussian proposal, and B-IntraSeismic with Conditional Normalizing Flows (BIS-Flow), which utilizes a mean-field unparametrized proposal distribution to better capture deviations from Gaussianity in the posterior distribution. These methods are evaluated on a synthetic data set (Marmousi) and two field data (Volve and Sleipner). Our results indicate that both BIS and BIS-Flow can accurately capture structural details and produce high-resolution mean models and standard deviation maps. BIS-Flow is also shown to be able to model complex posterior distributions, offering a more comprehensive characterization of uncertainty while maintaining computational feasibility.},
