    summary: |
      - Member of the KAUST Computational Imaging Group, focusing on diffusion models and generative architectures for scientific imaging. Current work includes hyperspectral data reconstruction and physics-informed inverse problems, leveraging high-performance computing resources for large-scale training and experimentation.

      - Extended IntraSeismic to a Bayesian formulation using deep variational inference for scalable uncertainty quantification. Introduced B-IntraSeismic and B-IntraSeismic Flow, which incorporate implicit neural representations and conditional normalizing flows to model complex, non-Gaussian posterior distributions.

      - Developed IntraSeismic, a novel hybrid seismic inversion framework that combines implicit neural representations with physical modeling to parameterize subsurface properties, achieving high reconstruction quality and rapid convergence in both static and dynamic settings.

    summary: |
      - Developed a joint inversion–segmentation framework for 4D post-stack seismic inversion that integrates total variation and segmentation priors to enhance resolution, suppress nonrepeatable noise, and classify subsurface changes. This work was recognized with the 2023 Best Paper Award by The Leading Edge journal.

      - Adapted a proximal optimization–based segmentation algorithm for GPU acceleration using CUDA via Numba, significantly improving computational efficiency. The project was recognized as one of the winning submissions at the KAUST–NVIDIA Hackathon for its innovation in high-performance scientific computing.

      - Applied Plug-and-Play regularization to improve post-stack seismic inversion, integrating CNN-based denoisers to replace hand-crafted model-based priors traditionally used in inverse problems.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
