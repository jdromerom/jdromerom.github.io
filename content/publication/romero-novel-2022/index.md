abstract: 'Summary Removing noise present in seismic data is of prime importance for
  seismic processing workflows and a matter of continuous research in the academic
  community. The challenging part of seismic noise suppression is the diverse nature
  of seismic noise: it is found as a combination of random and coloured noise, which
  can be both structured and unstructured. Algorithms based on signal decomposition,
  domain transformation, and filtering, among others, have been traditionally applied
  to denoise seismic data and have been successful for specific imaging targets, hence
  mostly identifying a specific seismic noise component. Recently, convolutional neural
  networks-based (CNN) denoisers have greatly outperformed standard denoising techniques
  mostly in natural and medical imaging applications, and furthermore, self-supervised
  frameworks have been proposed as a clever alternative to denoising when no ground
  truth exists. This work leverages four state-of-the-art U-Net type architectures
  in a novel self-supervised fashion to remove seismic noise. The training seismic
  data corresponds to a generous number of real seismic surveys. For the labelling,
  trace-wise corruption is applied to patches of the input data, so the CNN learns
  to predict the corrupted traces based on the receptive field. Our findings indicate
  that self-supervised learning using U-Net type architecture trained on real data
  is able to considerably remove both structured and unstructured seismic noise.'
