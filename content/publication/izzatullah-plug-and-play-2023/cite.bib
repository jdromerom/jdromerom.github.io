 abstract = {Summary Sampling from a target posterior distribution provides a fundamental approach to quantifying uncertainties in geophysical inverse problems. However, selecting appropriate prior information in probabilistic inversion is crucial (yet non-trivial) as it influences the ability of a sampling-based inference algorithm to provide geological realism in the posterior samples. To tackle such a challenge, we present a novel algorithm, called the Plug-and-Play Stein Variational Gradient Descent (PnP-SVGD), which allows sampling from a regularized target posterior distribution, where the target posterior distribution is regularized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoiser. By applying the proposed methodology to a post-stack seismic inversion problem on the Volve field data, we showcase its ability to produce high-resolution, geologically trustworthy samples representative of the subsurface structures, which we argue could be used for post-inference tasks such as reservoir modelling and history matching.},
