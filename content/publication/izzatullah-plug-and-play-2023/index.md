abstract: Summary Sampling from a target posterior distribution provides a fundamental
  approach to quantifying uncertainties in geophysical inverse problems. However,
  selecting appropriate prior information in probabilistic inversion is crucial (yet
  non-trivial) as it influences the ability of a sampling-based inference algorithm
  to provide geological realism in the posterior samples. To tackle such a challenge,
  we present a novel algorithm, called the Plug-and-Play Stein Variational Gradient
  Descent (PnP-SVGD), which allows sampling from a regularized target posterior distribution,
  where the target posterior distribution is regularized by a convolutional neural
  network (CNN) based denoiser. By applying the proposed methodology to a post-stack
  seismic inversion problem on the Volve field data, we showcase its ability to produce
  high-resolution, geologically trustworthy samples representative of the subsurface
  structures, which we argue could be used for post-inference tasks such as reservoir
  modelling and history matching.
