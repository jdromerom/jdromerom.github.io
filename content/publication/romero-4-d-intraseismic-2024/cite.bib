 abstract = {Summary Seismic monitoring is a crucial component for any subsurface project aimed at enhanced oil recovery or CO2 storage. 4D seismic inversion is a prominent methodology to retrieve quantitative inversion from time-lapse seismic data. This process is, however, an ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of the 4D seismic data. We introduce 4D-IntraSeismic, a novel approach to solve 4D seismic inverse problems that synergize coordinate-based learning with the physics of the 4D seismic modeling operator. The acoustic impedance baseline model and the associated time-lapse changes are parametrized by means of two sets of independent multiresolution spatial hash table and multilayer perceptron networks and jointly trained in an unsupervised manner. The effectiveness of 4D-IntraSeismic is demonstrated through comprehensive testing on both the synthetic Hess VTI model and field Sleipner dataset, and the inversion results are compared with those produced by a state-of-the-art variational method. These results showcase 4D-IntraSeismicâ€™s superior capabilities, particularly in achieving faster convergence and increased robustness to noise in the data.},
