abstract: Summary Seismic monitoring is a crucial component for any subsurface project
  aimed at enhanced oil recovery or CO2 storage. 4D seismic inversion is a prominent
  methodology to retrieve quantitative inversion from time-lapse seismic data. This
  process is, however, an ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy
  nature of the 4D seismic data. We introduce 4D-IntraSeismic, a novel approach to
  solve 4D seismic inverse problems that synergize coordinate-based learning with
  the physics of the 4D seismic modeling operator. The acoustic impedance baseline
  model and the associated time-lapse changes are parametrized by means of two sets
  of independent multiresolution spatial hash table and multilayer perceptron networks
  and jointly trained in an unsupervised manner. The effectiveness of 4D-IntraSeismic
  is demonstrated through comprehensive testing on both the synthetic Hess VTI model
  and field Sleipner dataset, and the inversion results are compared with those produced
  by a state-of-the-art variational method. These results showcase 4D-IntraSeismicâ€™s
  superior capabilities, particularly in achieving faster convergence and increased
  robustness to noise in the data.
