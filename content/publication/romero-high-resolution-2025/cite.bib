 abstract = {Summary This study introduces and evaluates two seismic time-strain inversion methods: total variation (TV), regularised inversion, and joint inversion with segmentation (JIS). Both methods effectively recover seismic time-strain while suppressing noise. Synthetic data experiments highlight the superior performance of JIS, which provides cleaner, more accurate estimates and segments the inverted strain into user-defined classes, enhancing interpretability and offering an indirect measure of uncertainty. Using a warm start, JIS achieves faster convergence and improved computational efficiency. These methods represent a robust framework for high-resolution, interpretable seismic analysis, with future work focusing on extending them to 3D field data for broader validation and scalability.},
