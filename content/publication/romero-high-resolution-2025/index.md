abstract: 'Summary This study introduces and evaluates two seismic time-strain inversion
  methods: total variation (TV), regularised inversion, and joint inversion with segmentation
  (JIS). Both methods effectively recover seismic time-strain while suppressing noise.
  Synthetic data experiments highlight the superior performance of JIS, which provides
  cleaner, more accurate estimates and segments the inverted strain into user-defined
  classes, enhancing interpretability and offering an indirect measure of uncertainty.
  Using a warm start, JIS achieves faster convergence and improved computational efficiency.
  These methods represent a robust framework for high-resolution, interpretable seismic
  analysis, with future work focusing on extending them to 3D field data for broader
  validation and scalability.'
