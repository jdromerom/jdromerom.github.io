abstract: Seismic reservoir characterization refers to a set of techniques aimed at
  estimating static and/or dynamic physical properties of subsurface geological formations
  from seismic data, with applications ranging from exploration and development of
  energy resources, geothermal production, carbon capture and storage, and the assessment
  of geological hazards. Extracting quantitative information from seismic recordings,
  such as an acoustic impedance model, is however a highly ill-posed inverse problem
  due to the band-limited and noisy nature of the seismic data. As such, seismic inversion
  techniques strongly rely on additional prior information that penalizes (or promotes)
  some features in the recovered model. This paper introduces IntraSeismic, a novel
  hybrid seismic inversion method that combines implicit neural representations as
  an effective way to parameterize a subsurface model with the physics of the seismic
  modeling operator. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both pre-stack and 3D/4D
  post-stack seismic inversion using synthetic and field data sets. Key features of
  IntraSeismic are (a) unparalleled performance in 2D and 3D pre-stack/post-stack
  dynamic and static seismic inversion, (b) rapid convergence rates, (c) ability to
  seamlessly include hard constraints (i.e., well data) and perform uncertainty quantification,
  and (d) potential data compression and fast randomized access to specific portions
  of the inverted model.
