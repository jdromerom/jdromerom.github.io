abstract: Summary Seismic monitoring is a crucial component for any CO2 subsurface
  storage project aimed at enhanced oil recovery or as part of a climate change mitigation
  strategy. The Sleipner CO2 monitoring programme is a repeated seismic survey acquired
  in the Norwegian North Sea to monitor the evolution of the injected CO2 plume in
  the subsurface and identify possible geohazards. Robust quantitative interpretation
  of the Sleipner dataset remains a challenge due to the non-repeatable noise between
  surveys and the tuning effects present in the data. In this work, we propose to
  apply a 4D joint inversion-segmentation approach with the aim of estimating the
  acoustic impedance models for the baseline and monitor datasets as well as classifying
  their difference into user-defined time-lapse classes. Introducing a segmentation
  constraint in the inversion process is beneficial in that it enforces the difference
  between the inverted models to belong to a predefined set of classes, minimizing
  the non-repeatable noise and enhancing genuine 4D changes. Our results are superior
  to those obtained with state-of-the-art least-squares inversion techniques and pave
  the way for an improved understanding of CO2 migration in the subsurface.
