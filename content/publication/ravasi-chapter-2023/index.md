abstract: Seismic reservoir characterization represents a cornerstone in the process
  of quantitatively analyzing and interpreting the subsurface. Whether seismic data
  are inverted for acoustic, elastic, and/or petrophysical properties, the associated
  inverse problem is usually hindered by the band-limited and noisy character of seismic
  data; prior information must therefore be provided to mitigate the ill-posed nature
  of such a problem. Common approaches to seismic inversion rely on a specific form
  of regularization, herein called external regularization, which tries to impose
  external knowledge of the subsurface (e.g., smoothness within layers or blockiness
  at layer discontinuities) on the sought-after properties. While the geophysical
  community is well versed with smooth priors such as Laplacian or directional Laplacian
  operators, advances in the field of convex optimization have recently led to the
  creation of more sophisticated seismic inversion engines that can include nonsmooth
  priors, such as total variation regularization. In this contribution, we present
  a unified approach to seismic inversion under the umbrella of convex optimization,
  which allows for the inclusion of different levels of prior knowledge encapsulating
  both our geophysical and geological understanding of the subsurface. More specifically,
  we discuss how the primal-dual solver represents an ideal optimization engine for
  the inclusion of external, internal (i.e., based on self-similarity within the solution),
  and geological priors in both static and dynamic post and prestack seismic reservoir
  characterization. Numerical examples of synthetic and field data are used to validate
  the effectiveness of our framework in extracting more information from seismic datasets,
  both in terms of resolution and accuracy, in comparison to other methods routinely
  used by the geophysical community.
