abstract: 'Summary We present B-IntraSeismic, a Bayesian framework that quantifies
  uncertainty in seismic inversion by combining variational inference with implicit
  neural representations. Our approach offers two implementations: BIS, which employs
  mean-field Gaussian approximation, and BIS-Flow, which captures complex posterior
  distributions using conditional normalizing flows. Testing on a synthetic dataset
  demonstrates that both methods generate high-resolution mean models and uncertainty
  estimates (in the form of standard deviation maps), with BIS-Flow particularly excelling
  at characterizing multimodal and skewed distributions in complex geological settings.
  This framework bridges the gap between traditional deterministic inversions and
  probabilistic approaches, offering a practical solution for large-scale Bayesian
  seismic inversion.'
