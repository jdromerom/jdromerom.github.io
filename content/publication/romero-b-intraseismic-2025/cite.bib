 abstract = {Summary We present B-IntraSeismic, a Bayesian framework that quantifies uncertainty in seismic inversion by combining variational inference with implicit neural representations. Our approach offers two implementations: BIS, which employs mean-field Gaussian approximation, and BIS-Flow, which captures complex posterior distributions using conditional normalizing flows. Testing on a synthetic dataset demonstrates that both methods generate high-resolution mean models and uncertainty estimates (in the form of standard deviation maps), with BIS-Flow particularly excelling at characterizing multimodal and skewed distributions in complex geological settings. This framework bridges the gap between traditional deterministic inversions and probabilistic approaches, offering a practical solution for large-scale Bayesian seismic inversion.},
