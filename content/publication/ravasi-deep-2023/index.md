abstract: Summary Seismic inversion represents a fundamental step in the process of
  linking seismic data to subsurface properties. Recently, many practitioners have
  started to argue that purely data-driven methodologies can outperform state-of-the-art
  model-based algorithms. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison between
  a variety of model-based, data-driven, and hybrid seismic inversion schemes and
  show that the above statement is only valid under favourable conditions, namely
  access to a dense distribution of wells capturing most (if not all) of the geological
  features in the subsurface of interest and knowledge of the background model (similar
  to model-based inversion). Finally, we propose a novel strategy that incorporates
  data-driven estimates as soft-prior in hybrid inversion schemes, achieving best-in-class
  accuracy over all other methods.
